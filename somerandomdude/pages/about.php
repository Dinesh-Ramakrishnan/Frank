<p>I am a product designer living in San Francisco. I have worked for companies such as <a href='http://adaptivepath.com'>Adaptive Path</a>, <a href='http://method.com'>Method</a> and <a href="http://current.com/">Current TV</a> and have worked with the United Nations, <a href='http://adobe.com'>Adobe</a>, <a href='http://www.ted.com'>Ted.com</a> and various other organizations.</p> 
<p>This blog is my place to collect all my thoughts, work and findings to share with the public. I am a big fan of dialog and constructive confrontation; I enjoy being shown how I am wrong, which happens frequently. Most of all, I enjoy learning new things and having my ideas be challenged. I cannot think of a better person to learn from than you.</p>

<p>I love hearing from people for pretty much any reason. Please feel free to hit me up on any subject matter, but please be warned that I can <em>sometimes</em> be a hard guy to get a hold of depending on what is going on with life outside of the computer - yes, I still (barely) have one. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
